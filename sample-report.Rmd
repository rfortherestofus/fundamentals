# Introduction

This report is the best report ever. Pretty much the **bees' knees**. Can't say that I've *ever* seen a better report.

## Reasons Why This Report is the Best

- It's amazing
- It's quite amazing
- It's seriously amazing

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, include = FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(skimr)

skim(cars)
```
